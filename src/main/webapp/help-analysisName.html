        This field lets you set a "name" for each Code Dx analysis published from Jenkins.
        Analysis names are mainly used to identify the bars in the "First Seen" and "Last Modified" filters on Code Dx's Findings page.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use build/environment variables to construct a different name for each analysis. For example:
        <pre><code>Build #${BUILD_NUMBER}</code></pre>
        would create the name `Build #26` for the 26th build of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can construct links using a syntax similar to markdown, i.e. <code>[link text](link url)</code>. This also works with build variables:
        <pre><code>Build [#${BUILD_NUMBER}]($BUILD_URL)</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some Jenkins plugins, like the Git plugin, provide "macros" which allow for some additional customization.
        In this example, the analysis name will be set to the first 8 characters of the git commit hash:
        <pre><code>${GIT_REVISION, length=8}</code></pre>
        For more information on "macros", see the
        <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin" target="_blank">Token Macro Plugin Wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: the analysis name feature is only supported by Code Dx versions 2.4.0 and up. If the server you plan
        to publish to is older than version 2.4.0, the analysis name will be ignored.
